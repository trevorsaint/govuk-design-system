{% from "_example.njk" import example %}

Make a page easier to scan by letting users reveal more detailed information only if they need it.

{{ example({group: "components", item: "details", example: "default", html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false, size: "s"}) }}

## When to use this component

Use the details component to make a page easier to scan when it contains information that only some users will need.

## When not to use this component

Do not use the details component to hide information that the majority of your users will&nbsp;need.

## Details, accordions and tabs

Details, [accordions](/components/accordion/), and [tabs](/components/tabs/) all hide sections of content which a user can choose to reveal.

Use the details component instead of tabs or an accordion if you only have 1 section of content.

The details component is less visually prominent than tabs and accordions, so tends to work better for content which is not as important to users.

## How it works

The details component is a short link that expands into more detailed help text when a user clicks on it.

There are 2 ways to use the details component. You can use HTML or, if you are using [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) or the [GOV.UK Prototype Kit](https://govuk-prototype-kit.herokuapp.com), you can use the Nunjucks macro.

{{ example({group: "components", item: "details", example: "default", html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false, size: "s", titleSuffix: "second"}) }}

### Write clear link text

Make the link text short and descriptive so users can quickly work out if they need to click on it.
